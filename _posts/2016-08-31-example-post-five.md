There is a limitation on abilities of tiny robots and their applications with complex computer vision algorithms.

This project aims to test the limits of computer vision in a small robot (Petoi Bittle) as computer vision is not widely explored in tiny robots. By applying computer vision algorithms where it is able to do some specific task for example object classification, obstacle avoidance, and face detection. Also aims to test cameras with limited capability such as the MU Vision Sensor 3 to be able to function computer vision tasks properly. If these algorithms are successfully implemented to the robot, ‘hide and seek’ feature may be introduced to the robot to see if it is able to implement different algorithms at the same time.
