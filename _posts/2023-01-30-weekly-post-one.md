Having a more concrete idea on the project and concrete plan on approaching the project. Wrote a final draft/ idea of the project and rough approach of the project. Decided what kind of algorithms to approach the project. By enabling the computer vision to be able to perform object classification/object detection, obstacle avoidance, and face detection.
