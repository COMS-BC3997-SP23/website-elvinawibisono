This week I have finished setting up the necessary hardwares and softwares for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. I ran into some troubles setting up the hardware and the monitor for Raspberry Pi Zero, especially tring to connect to Wifi and establishing SSH. Here in this weeek I focus in debugging the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W , wpa_supplicant.conf, file so it can connect the wifi. I eventually was able to connect to the Wifi and estbalish SSH at the end of the week.
