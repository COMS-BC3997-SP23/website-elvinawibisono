## How does Computer Vision in Tiny Robots differ from regular to large sized robots? 

This project aims to test the limits of computer vision in a small robot (Petoi Bittle) as computer vision is not widely explored in tiny robots. By applying computer vision algorithms where it is able to do some specific task for example object classification, obstacle avoidance, and face detection. Also aims to test cameras with limited capability such as the MU Vision Sensor 3 to be able to function computer vision tasks properly. If these algorithms are successfully implemented to the robot, ‘hide and seek’ feature may be introduced to the robot to see if it is able to implement different algorithms at the same time


## Why research this topic?
There is a limitation on abilities of tiny robots and their applications with complex computer vision algorithms


## Rough approach towards the project: 
+ Bittle can be able to identify obstacles/objects (for example, as bittle is walking and find obstacles it will stop and sit down) 
+ Bittle can perform obstacle avoidance (for example, as bittle is walking it is able to determine to go over obstacles) 
+ Bittle can also perform face detection 

## The end product: 
Bittle is able to perform/ play hide and seek, where it is able to identify both obstacles and targets to find. 

## Updates 
+ Instead of using the MU Vision Sensor 3 (the given camera from Bittle), Rasperry Pi camera will be used instead
